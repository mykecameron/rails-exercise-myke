# Cartwheel take-home exercise

* If your environment is not set up to run a rails app, follow the installation instructions at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails.
* For simplicity, this app uses a SQLite3 database so make sure that is installed.
* Clone the repository, run `bundle`, and also make sure you run `rails db:seed` so you have data to work with.
* Run this rails app using `bin/dev` (we use Tailwind and that will auto-compile the CSS).
* Visit localhost:3000 to see the instructions for the exercise.
